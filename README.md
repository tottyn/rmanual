## About The Manual

This site hosts **Introducing RStudio:** *Hands-On Learning and Career Readiness in the Social, Behavioral, and Educational Sciences*. This manual is designed to introduce students in the social, behavioral, and educational sciences to RStudio and its basic uses with **applications** to relevant data. Benefits of this lab manual include:

- Guided RStudio lab activities.
  
- Instructor-led and independent practice.
  
- Real-world dataset (the General Social Survey) relevant to the social, behavioral, and educational sciences.
  
- Career readiness reflections connecting statistical skills to workforce competencies.


## How to Use This Website

On this website you can download:

- The lab manual as a PDF.

- A subset of the GSS data in CSV format. This is the dataset used in the labs.

- An R script that contains all the R code used in the manual.

**Note that these files contain solutions which students may use to check their work.** Instructors may choose to remove these pages from the PDF and code from the R script before sharing with students. Alternatively, instructors can adapt the practice problems for use as a graded practice assessment.



## Code of Conduct

All files on this repo are released under the following [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md). Please submit an issue for any questions and concerns. I do not own the GSS dataset hosted here. It is a subset obtained from the Data Explorer linked in the manual.
